# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
Case Study in Final Course of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program.


## Introduction  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This case study will be for the fictional bike sharing company Cyclistic. I will be acting as a Junior Data Analyst with marketing team. The steps for this data analysis will follow the process of: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.


## About Company and Goals
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Cyclist is a bike-share company based out of Chicago. They have 5,824 bicycles with 692 stations throughout Chicago. The bikes are geotracked and can be dropped off or picked up from any station at any time. They believe that the future of their company will have better success if they can convert casual riders into annual members.


## Ask  
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To answer the question of how to convert casual riders into annual riders the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ. I have been assigned to answer the question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclist biked differently?

Questions to ask: 
  * Frequency of different users on each day of the week.
  * Ride length differences of different users
  * What day of the week is most popular for different users
  * Average age of riders
  * Gender of riders
  * What casual and members use bikes in different seasons
  * Most popular times of day

## Prepare

The .csv data files can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). Some of the files are too large to open in excel so I decided to upload them into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The column headers were not consistent
